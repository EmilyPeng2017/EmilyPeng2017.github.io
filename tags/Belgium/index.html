<p>I was recently invited to join a competition—but there was a catch: teams had to include at least three people. So, I reached out to two close colleagues who I deeply trust.</p>
<!--- read more --->

<p>As I often do, I immediately started preparing everything I could think of—gathering materials, outlining the scope, and mapping out the architecture of our presentation. Out of habit, I only assigned small tasks to them. Honestly, I’ve always felt uncomfortable asking others to do too much. If I’m the organizer or team lead, I believe it’s my responsibility to carry the bulk of the work.</p>
<p>But something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>My two incredible teammates didn’t just help—they owned their parts. They brought fresh ideas, crafted beautiful slides, and contributed thoughtful writing for the proposal. They showed patience, skill, and a spirit of collaboration that truly moved me.</p>
<p>For the first time in a long while, I didn’t feel like I was carrying the weight alone. And the results? Far better than anything I could have done solo.</p>
<p>I’m so grateful for this experience—and for them.</p>
<p>Teamwork really does make the dream work.</p>

<p>I was recently invited to visit a retired teacher from our campus for lunch at his home. I was so happy—this was the first time a Belgian person had ever invited me to their home. In China, we often do this more casually and frequently, so this gesture felt both warm and rare.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7WMBr1ZoWY">A great song I really like recently</a></p>
<h1 id="Grateful-Encounters"><a href="#Grateful-Encounters" class="headerlink" title="Grateful Encounters"></a>Grateful Encounters</h1><p>I truly feel grateful for the people in my life who help me without expecting anything in return.<br>This teacher is one of them.</p>
<p>When I first arrived on campus and began working on my experiments, I didn’t have a proper place to set up my 3D printer.<br>One evening around 7:00 p.m., most colleagues had already left, and I was sitting on the ground doing some tests. The printer was temporarily placed on the floor because there was simply nowhere else to put it.</p>
<p>At that time, I didn’t know when or where I could find a better space—my supervisor was very busy, and I was still new.</p>
<p>That evening, this teacher passed by my lab, saw me sitting there, and said hi before leaving.<br>But the next day, he came back and asked if I needed help. He said it wasn’t appropriate to work like that and kindly offered his assistance.</p>
<p>As a sensitive person, I almost cried at that moment.</p>
<p>Then he emailed my supervisor and expressed his willingness to help resolve the situation.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="A-Helping-Hand"><a href="#A-Helping-Hand" class="headerlink" title="A Helping Hand"></a>A Helping Hand</h1><p>Over the following month, he:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Helped me find a proper space for my printer</p>
</li>
<li><p>Searched on AliExpress for the right tools</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even drove around town to find equipment to help exhaust the toxic gas from the printer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It struck me then that caring for others isn’t always natural—it’s something we can learn by example.<br>And I learned it from him.</p>
<p>Everything got resolved smoothly thanks to his help.<br>He was like a grandfather or father figure—not connected to my project, yet he stepped in without hesitation.<br>It moved me deeply, and I promised myself to become that kind of person too.</p>
<h1 id="Unexpected-Friendship"><a href="#Unexpected-Friendship" class="headerlink" title="Unexpected Friendship"></a>Unexpected Friendship</h1><p>Believe it or not, sometimes you just click with people without needing a reason.<br>Eventually, we became good friends—from my perspective, at least.</p>
<p>Before visiting him today, I prepared a few interview questions 😊<br>We ended up talking from 12:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.—five hours flew by!</p>
<h1 id="A-Life-of-Teaching-and-Discipline"><a href="#A-Life-of-Teaching-and-Discipline" class="headerlink" title="A Life of Teaching and Discipline"></a>A Life of Teaching and Discipline</h1><p>He began teaching in 1982, shortly after leaving the military.<br>Although his army service lasted only ten months, it taught him valuable lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Self-discipline</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leadership</p>
</li>
<li><p>Teamwork</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>He believes these are qualities many young people lack today.<br>Teaching wasn’t originally part of his plan, but it turned out to be a great opportunity—and he embraced it.</p>
<h1 id="On-Networking-and-Courage"><a href="#On-Networking-and-Courage" class="headerlink" title="On Networking and Courage"></a>On Networking and Courage</h1><p>We talked about networking. He said it’s essential—not about using others, but about saving time and energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you can use others, others can use you too.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Networking is like a phone book—you don’t use it every day, but it’s there when you need it.<br>It’s different from friendship, which is built on shared memories and interests.<br>Networking is more about career growth.</p>
<p>He shared a story:<br>A student once wanted to work on a rocket project, and he happened to know someone in that field.<br>He introduced them, and now the student is doing well.<br>Networking, he said, is often a win-win situation.</p>
<p>I told him I often feel shy about reaching out, even though I appear outgoing.<br>He encouraged me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t be afraid. Just keep practicing—you’ll get used to it. It’s a skill.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Gaining-Experience-Finding-Direction"><a href="#Gaining-Experience-Finding-Direction" class="headerlink" title="Gaining Experience, Finding Direction"></a>Gaining Experience, Finding Direction</h1><p>He also told me that when he was younger, he struggled with other people’s opinions and felt life was out of control.<br>But with time and experience, he began to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Steer the direction of his work</p>
</li>
<li><p>Speak with more confidence and impact</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree—it’s a process.<br>We can’t expect to do only what we love when we’re still young and inexperienced.</p>
<h1 id="Regrets-and-Pride"><a href="#Regrets-and-Pride" class="headerlink" title="Regrets and Pride"></a>Regrets and Pride</h1><p>One thing he regretted was not doing a PhD.<br>I think he had a passion for research, and not having a doctorate might’ve limited some opportunities.</p>
<p>But the happy side?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past 42 years, he spent most of his time doing work he genuinely enjoyed.<br>That’s a kind of perfection, isn’t it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I asked him what he was most proud of, he said: his family.</p>
<p>He lives a happy life and cherishes his relationship.<br>A small but touching detail:<br>Every workday, he rides his bike to meet his wife after her work, and then they ride home together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What a lovely couple! ❤️</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Differences-and-Understanding"><a href="#Differences-and-Understanding" class="headerlink" title="Differences and Understanding"></a>Differences and Understanding</h1><p>We also talked about politics and the current world.<br>As a Chinese person who loves her country deeply, I naturally had different opinions.<br>I’ll summarize those discussions in another post.</p>
<h1 id="What-I’ve-Learned"><a href="#What-I’ve-Learned" class="headerlink" title="What I’ve Learned"></a>What I’ve Learned</h1><p>His life might look ordinary at first glance.<br>But to me, his passion for education and his kindness toward life are extraordinary—and worth learning from.</p>
<p>I still feel lucky to have a senior friend who’s willing to show me what life can be.</p>

Since I needed to put my samples into a vacuum chamber, I was told it would be best to leave them inside for a whole day. But because of the long distance, I decided to go very early and finish everything in one day. I was surprised to find that it’s even possible to book night or weekend sessions for the SEM. Somehow, this is exactly what I expect from a good research institute or university — flexible access that respects how research really works.</p>
<p>I don’t want to glorify overworking, but there should be an environment that allows researchers to work late when they need to — whether because experiments take a long time, or because some people simply do their best work at night. On my Brugge campus, this is impossible. There are strict checks by a third-party security company, and I always have to leave before midnight. I’ve been warned many times not to stay alone in the building for safety reasons.</p>
<p>But despite the early start, I had a really good working day in Leuven. After preparing my samples, I went to the canteen for lunch and ended up sitting with a big group of Chinese students. We talked about the research atmosphere back home, each other’s projects, and funny things that have happened to us here in Belgium. It had been a long time since I’d had such a warm, lively conversation with so many people. I’m not the talkative girl I once was — now I’m quieter, a listener, and I really like this version of myself: calm, thoughtful, and curious.</p>
<p>Back in the lab, I wasn’t familiar with one of the coating machines. A Belgian colleague I hadn’t met before was so kind — he patiently showed me how to use it step by step, and even explained the principles behind each step. By 8 p.m., I had finished all my tests. I was exhausted, but grateful — and happy with the results.</p>
<p>What touched me most was the bright lights of the building as I left. So many people were still working, or at least still there, deep into the night. Sometimes, I feel like an alien on my Brugge campus — I try to hide how much I love working hard, because it’s not always understood. But deep down, I know why I’m here: for research, not for entertainment. I know how to enjoy life — but for me, doing my work is part of that joy.</p>
<p>Where we are does not define who we are. Today reminded me of that — and made me feel grateful all over again.</p>

If my mind wanders even slightly, mistakes slip in—sometimes with frustrating consequences.</p>
<p>Take today (well, technically yesterday). After spending the whole day mixing a solution, I accidentally poured it into a dirty beaker. Just one moment of inattention, and all that effort went to waste. It drove me crazy.</p>
<p>Even the simple act of weighing particles on a balance demands complete focus and patience. Preparing five groups for a comparative experiment can easily take over an hour. There’s no rushing it. Every grain matters.</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t enjoy this kind of work when I first started. It felt repetitive and lacking in technical creativity. But something has changed. Recently, I’ve found that when I fully immerse myself in the process, a sense of inner stillness takes over. My thoughts settle. My attention sharpens. My heart feels… clean.</p>
<p>That feeling—that calm flow of presence—is perfect. And I think that, maybe, this quiet discipline is a kind of innovation. Not in the tools or the results, but in myself.</p>
