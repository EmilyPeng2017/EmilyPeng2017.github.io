These sensors enable customizable conductivity, layer thickness, and sensor dimensions, paving the way for advanced applications in flexible electronics. ❓ Research GapFlexible pressure sensors have seen significant advancements, particularly through material optimization and innovative 3D printing techniques. However: ⚡ Most studies focus on low graphene content composites. 🔧 Few have explored tunable sensors with adjustable properties like conductivity and layer structure. 🚫 A need remains for high graphene content composites for enhanced functionality. 💡 Key Insights🌟 Edge Functionalized Expanded Graphene (EFXG)EFXG, derived from expanded graphite, exhibits: ✅ High solvent dispersibility (100 mg/ml). 🔬 Excellent potential for enhancing composite properties in 3D printing applications. ⚙️ Methods🛠 ProblemIncorporating graphene into Sylgard 184 (a PDMS material) during simultaneous mixing of all components led to poor crosslinking when graphene content exceeded 5 wt.%. 🧪 SolutionA two-step process was developed: 🔄 Mixing and Pre-Crosslinking: Combine Sylgard 184 prepolymer and initiator, then heat at 60°C for 1 hour to initiate crosslinking. ➕ Graphene Addition: Introduce graphene post-initiation to reduce its hindering effect on the crosslinking process. 📊 Results 📏 Printability Limitation: Graphene content exceeding 12% caused unprintable viscosity levels. ⚡ High Conductivity: Composites with 60% graphene achieved superior electrical performance. 🎨 Questions for myself What is Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy used for? FTIR: A technique used to identify organic, polymeric, and some inorganic materials by measuring how different wavelengths of infrared light are absorbed by the material, providing information about molecular bonds and functional groups. Raman Spectroscopy: Complements FTIR by measuring inelastic scattering of light to identify vibrational modes of molecules, providing insights into molecular structures, crystallinity, and chemical composition. What is Newtonian behavior? Newtonian Behavior: Refers to fluids whose viscosity remains constant regardless of the applied shear rate or stress. Examples include water and most simple oils. What is the relationship between viscosity and shear rate? For Newtonian fluids, viscosity is constant and independent of shear rate. For non-Newtonian fluids, viscosity changes with shear rate: Shear-thinning (pseudoplastic): Viscosity decreases as shear rate increases (e.g., ketchup). Shear-thickening (dilatant): Viscosity increases as shear rate increases (e.g., cornstarch in water). What is viscoelasticity? What is loss modulus and storage modulus? Viscoelasticity: A material property where the substance exhibits both viscous (fluid-like) and elastic (solid-like) behavior under deformation. Loss Modulus (G’’): Represents the energy dissipated as heat (viscous component). Storage Modulus (G’): Represents the energy stored and recovered per cycle (elastic component). What is the recovery behavior of printing ink under stress? Is it necessary to test all the above properties? Recovery Behavior: Refers to the ability of ink to regain its original structure after stress is removed, crucial for maintaining print quality during and after extrusion. Testing recovery behavior helps evaluate print fidelity. Testing all properties depends on the application requirements. For high-precision applications, it’s often necessary to test rheological and viscoelastic properties. What microscopy and morphology tests have they done? Common techniques include Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for surface topography and structural details, and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) for nanoscale surface characterization. Additional tests may involve Optical Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for detailed internal morphology. What is gauge factor? Gauge Factor (GF): The ratio of relative change in electrical resistance to the mechanical strain applied to a material. It’s a key parameter for evaluating the sensitivity of strain sensors. 🗣 DiscussionThe temperature-induced crosslinking approach effectively addresses challenges posed by high graphene content. This study demonstrates how tailored 3D-printed composites can unlock new possibilities in flexible pressure sensor design. 🌟 Personal InsightsThis paper inspired me to think about the balance between material composition and manufacturing techniques.

Being buried in work often makes my body feel heavy, but running gives me a much-needed reset. The first 3 km is always the hardest, but once I push through, I feel lighter by the 5 km mark, and even start to pick up speed. Today’s weather was delightful, with a light drizzle in Brugge (which I actually enjoy ^_^). The fresh air felt rejuvenating, and during my run, I came across a family of coots, along with pigeons, seagulls, and a variety of other birds I couldn’t name.

I picked up some fresh fruits and a beautiful flower for a colleague. Later in the afternoon, I met with a group of Chinese colleagues and made dumplings together. The weather today was absolutely perfect. The sun shone brightly, casting a golden glow over everything, and the world seemed to hum with joy. The trees proudly displayed their light green leaves, the river sparkled as if singing a gentle melody, and a soft breeze carried a touch of magic through the fresh air. But the true highlight of my day was an enchanting encounter with a little bird, a robin! I first fell in love with robins when I saw one on the M&amp;S cookie box. They’re such adorable birds-small, round, and plump, like little furry balls. While they’re quite common here in Bruges, they’re usually shy and quick to dart into the bushes, making it hard to get a good look or take a photo. But today, something magical happened. While I was running, a robin actually stopped to say hi! It was such a clever and curious little bird, it didn’t seem afraid of me at all. It perched on a tree branch and just stared at me, as if waiting for me to notice it. Me: “Stay right there, please! Let me take your picture.”Robin: “Okay, but make it a good one!”Me: “Hmm, you’re a bit too far. Can you come a little closer?”Robin (flying closer): “How about now?” We stood there together under the warm sunshine, and for a moment, it felt like we understood each other.

It was quite an eventful experience for several reasons: 1. A Challenging Business TripThis was my first time traveling for work with a colleague, and it made me realize how much I still need to improve when working alongside others. The trip wasn’t without its challenges, my colleague had a high fever during the conference, and I experienced acclimatization issues from the second day, which left me vomiting the entire night. After returning to Belgium, I came down with a high fever for two days, during which I was bedridden and barely conscious. Ending the year in such a way was definitely a unique experience, though not one I’d want to repeat! 2. Exploring Abu DhabiDespite the challenges, I managed to enjoy some of Abu Dhabi’s highlights. I saw a stunning desert sunset, went on a desert safari, rode a camel, and visited the breathtaking Sheikh Zayed Mosque. However, I realized I’m a bit of a sentimental traveler. I always feel something is missing when I can’t share these experiences with my husband or close friends. That said, Abu Dhabi is a fantastic place to visit, and I found myself wishing several times that my husband could have been there to experience it with me. 3. Thoughts on the Conference As a relatively new researcher, every conference I attend leaves me with a strong urge to return to my lab and dive into experiments. At times, I find the social aspects of these events overwhelming or even somewhat meaningless because I feel I’m not yet strong enough to collaborate effectively with others. A voice in my head constantly tells me, “Work harder, Emily!”. AI and machine learning dominated much of the research presented at the conference, which initially felt discouraging since these aren’t my areas of expertise. However, I’ve resolved not to fall behind. If AI is a valuable tool, I need to familiarize myself with it and find ways to integrate it into my work. As a first step, I’ve added “learning machine learning” to my 2025 to-do list, and I’m determined to make progress in this field. One of the keynotes I was most excited about was “Sensory Interventions: Real-time integration of passive sensing and adaptive passive interventions” by Prof. Tanzeem Choudhury from Cornell Tech. While I had high expectations for this presentation, I must admit I left feeling a bit disappointed. The speaker only briefly touched upon the subject and didn’t delve into the detailed or advanced technologies I was hoping to learn more about. However, I understand that this is often the nature of a conference keynote During the Q&amp;A session, I asked whether heart rate was the only parameter they used to assess emotion and whether they had considered any invasive sensing methods. The answer was “yes” and “no.” I couldn’t help but think about how deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery has already been verified as a promising approach to treating depression [1]. To me, it seems like DBS represents the gold standard for addressing emotional disorders. By comparison, their team’s non-invasive approach, relying solely on heart rate, initially felt overly simplistic and limited. However, after reflecting on it, I realized their method has its merits. For cases that are not treatment-resistant depression, why not explore simpler, non-invasive ways to address the problem? If it works, it could be an accessible and practical solution for many people. Interestingly, this aligns with what I aim to achieve for diabetic patients—finding effective, non-invasive methods to improve their quality of life.

Dutch is interesting!","text":"Language learning is an adventure full of surprises, and Dutch has been no exception for me. During a casual conversation in class yesterday, I stumbled upon an amusing linguistic quirk that left me both puzzled and entertained. Here’s what happened: 💬 Classmate A: Hoe oefen je Nederlands??(How do you practice your Dutch?) 🧑‍🎓 Me: Ik oefen Nederlands met mijn vrienden.(I practice it with my friends.) 👩‍🎓 Classmate B: Een man of een vrouw?(A man or a woman?) 🤔 Me: They are just my friends. Why does the gender matter? 💡 Classmate B: Ah, but in Dutch, “vriend” or “vriendin” often means boyfriend or girlfriend! Curious about this, I asked our teacher:👩‍🏫 Me: Is there any way to express a “normal friend”? Our teacher, a very kind lady, paused to think. After a moment, she smiled and said:“Emm, good question. But no, there is no ‘normal friend’ in Dutch. When we say ‘vriend’ or ‘vriendin,’ it usually refers to romantic relationships. 😊” This little exchange made me realize just how fascinating and nuanced languages can be. 🧠✨ As a learner, these moments of cultural insight are both challenging and rewarding. 🌍✍️ Update:My local colleague explained that using the plural form “vrienden” is perfectly fine and simply means “friends.” However, using “mijn vriend” or “mijn vriendin” typically implies a romantic relationship.","link":"/2025/01/10/Vriend-of-Vriendin-Dutch-is-interesting/"},{"title":"Valentine&#39;s Day: A test for generating a video for my friend","text":"Last night, I received a Valentine-themed video in Arabic from a colleague. Although I couldn’t understand the lyrics, I caught the words “إيميلي إيميلي” at the end, which means “Emily, Emily.” I was deeply moved, not just by the song but by the warmth of having such a thoughtful colleague and friend. However, this friend has been separated from his wife for nearly two years due to circumstances beyond their control. The thought of their situation brought tears to my eyes as I drifted off to sleep. 😢 When I woke up, an idea came to me: why not create a video for my colleague and his wife? I’m familiar with Adobe Premiere, but I wanted to try some new AI-powered video generation tools. The Search for the Right AI Video ToolMy goal was to use some pictures of my colleague and his wife, along with a romantic song I downloaded from YouTube, to create a heartwarming video that tells their story. I envisioned a video with a cohesive color palette fitting the Valentine’s theme, rather than just a simple slideshow of pictures. I tried several well-known AI video tools, including Pictory, AI Studios, and Animoto. Unfortunately, none of them met my expectations. Here’s what I encountered: Limited Creativity: Most tools simply combined the uploaded pictures with the background music and then pulled random videos based on keywords from my description. The selected clips were often irrelevant, with mismatched colors that disrupted the storytelling. Poor Thematic Consistency: Even when the tools found videos, they lacked a consistent aesthetic. The Valentine’s theme I hoped for was nowhere to be seen. Lack of Genuine Storytelling: I expected the AI to generate visuals that evoke emotions and convey a narrative, but most results felt generic and disconnected. After spending the entire morning experimenting with these tools (yes, I usually stay focused on my research, but this was a special occasion for a friend, right? 🫡), I eventually gave up and switched back to Adobe Premiere. Ironically, the time I had hoped to save by using AI tools was lost in the process. Reflections on the Current State of AI Video ToolsWhile I’ve seen some impressive AI-generated content online, my experience today was disappointing. It made me reflect on a few key points: Customization is Key: Personalization should be at the core of any AI tool. If every user ends up with the same generic video style, the tool loses its value. AI and the Future of Interfaces: In the future, we might move away from portal websites altogether. Tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek could become personal digital assistants, helping us book tickets, plan trips, or even create personalized videos directly through natural conversations. Personality in AI Products: Different AI tools seem to have distinct personalities. For instance, while DeepSeek impresses me with its deep knowledge of Chinese history, it often comes across as overly formal. In contrast, ChatGPT feels like a genuine friend—one who encourages me to become a better version of myself. In fact, I often refer to ChatGPT as “she” because of the warmth and support I feel in our interactions. Final ThoughtsWhile today’s AI video tools fell short, I remain hopeful that more intuitive and creative solutions will emerge in the near future. Until then, I’ll stick with Adobe Premiere for my special video projects. And to my friend: Due to time limitation, I finally sent a sentence to my friend but not a video. I hope this small gesture brings a smile to your face and warms your heart, just as your thoughtful Valentine’s video did for me. ❤️","link":"/2025/02/14/Valentine's-day/"},{"title":"There is no diabetic foot in heaven","text":"Today, I learned that my landlord’s mom underwent euthanasia. It left me reflecting on a conversation we had not long ago. It was a typical day when I returned to my studio and stopped by my landlord’s place to pick up a package. We started chatting casually, and he asked me, “Why do you always work so late, Emily?” I laughed and replied, “Well, probably because I’m not that smart.” As the conversation flowed, I shared details about my project. He seemed genuinely intrigued and, in turn, shared a deeply personal story about his mother. She had been diagnosed with diabetic foot several years ago. From what I know, the prognosis is grim once diabetic foot is discovered. It’s often already too late for effective treatment. His mother was over 90 years old, making surgery an impossible option. He mentioned that the family was considering euthanasia for her. I was surprised to learn that euthanasia is legal in Belgium. It’s a humane option for those suffering, but hearing it from someone I know gave me a new perspective on its profound impact. I never thought the day he mentioned would come so soon. And yet, here we are. 20230218 update:I saw my landlord today. Once an energetic man, he now looked tired and distant. “Sometimes I pick up my phone, wanting to call my mom,” he said. “Then I remember, she’s gone.

For instance, taking the subway in Shanghai typically costs only 4 to 6 RMB (approximately €0.5 to €0.8). That’s pocket change! 🤑 As someone used to this cost-efficiency, traveling in Belgium, or any other European country, feels like public transport is reaching directly into my wallet! 😂💸 The Brussels Airport Supplement: My “Door Shock” Moment 🚪😱So, imagine my reaction when I discovered the infamous Brussels Airport Supplement! I was shocked to learn that I needed to buy an additional ticket just to access the airport via train. That’s right, this isn’t about your regular train fare; it’s an extra charge simply to go through the “airport door.” 🤑 Talk about an expensive entrance fee! 😬✈️ Screenshot of the SNCB supplement ticket. Why Is There a Supplement? 💡After some digging, I discovered that this charge is linked to the Diabolo Project, which simplifies train connections to Brussels Airport for people in cities like Antwerp, Leuven, and Namur. Here’s how it works: Public/Private Partnership: The Diabolo Project is funded by Northern Diabolo NV through a public-private model. User-Pays Principle: The cost of this project is passed directly to passengers who use it, via a supplement added to your train ticket. Good News for Non-Users: If you don’t take the train to the airport, you don’t have to pay for this infrastructure. Fair enough, right? 🤔 You can read more about the supplement on the SNCB portal. The China Difference 🇨🇳💰🚇In contrast, public transportation in China operates on a heavily subsidized model, making it accessible to everyone. Whether you’re a daily commuter or an occasional traveler, the government ensures that public transport remains affordable and inclusive. For example: Subsidized Infrastructure: Massive investments in metro systems don’t directly impact ticket prices. Flat or Low Pricing: Even premium routes like airport express trains cost far less compared to European standards. A Global Perspective 🌍Interestingly, similar supplement tickets exist at other airports worldwide, such as Copenhagen Airport, Frankfurt Airport, and Oslo Airport. These charges are often justified by specific infrastructure projects or enhancements aimed at improving airport connectivity. If I get the chance to travel more, I’d love to explore how these systems compare! ✈️🛤️ While the user-pays model in Belgium is logical, it ensures that only those who use the service cover its costs, it contrasts sharply with China’s government-funded approach. Each has its merits, but I must admit, my wallet definitely misses China’s affordable transport! 😅💼 One question lingers in my mind: if projects like Diabolo earn enough money over time, for example, after ten years, when ticket revenue covers the project’s expenses, will they still charge the supplement? Or will it be removed? 🫣🫣","link":"/2025/01/13/Why-do-we-need-to-pay-Brussels-Airport-Supplement/"},{"title":"eWEAR Seminar: AI insights from wearable sensors_Stanford University","text":"Tonight, I had the opportunity to remotely attend a seminar held at Stanford University, where two insightful presentations shed light on advancements in wearable sensors.

Create a test setCreating a test set is theoretically simple; pick some instances randomly, typically 20% of the dataset (or less if your dataset is very large), and set them aside: 123456def shuffle_and_split_data(data, test_ratio): shuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(len(data)) test_set_size = int(len(data) * test_ratio) test_indices = shuffled_indices[:test_set_size] train_indices = shuffled_indices[test_set_size:] return data.iloc[train_indices], data.iloc[test_indices] then we can use the function to get the test set: 12345&gt;&gt;&gt; train_set, test_set = shuffle_and_split_data(housing, 0.2)&gt;&gt;&gt; len(train_set)16512&gt;&gt;&gt; len(test_set)4128 the problem is: once we run the program again, it will generate a different test set. Over time, we will get to see the whole dataset.solution: to save the test set on the first run and then load it in subsequent runs. to set the random number generator’s seed (using np.random.seed(42)) before calling np.random.permutation() so it always generates the same shuffled indices.another problem comes: above solutions will break the next time we fetch an updated dataset.solution: to have a stable train/test split even after updating the dataset, a common solution is to use each instance’s identifier to decide whether or not it should go in the test set. For example, to compute a hash of each instance’s identifier and put that instance in the test set if the hash is lower than or equal to 20% of the maximum hash value. This ensures that the test set will remain consistent across multiple runs, even if we refresh the dataset. 123456789from zlib import crc32def is_id_in_test_set(identifier, test_ratio): return crc32(np.int64(identifier)) &lt; test_ratio * 2**32def split_data_with_id_hash(data, test_ratio, id_column): ids = data[id_column] in_test_set = ids.apply(lambda id_: is_id_in_test_set(id_, test_ratio)) return data.loc[~in_test_set], data.loc[in_test_set] Scikit-Learn provides a few functions to split datasets into multiple subsets in various ways. The simplest function is train_test_split(), which does pretty much the same thing as the shuffle_and_split_data() function. there is a random_state parameter that allows us to set the random generator seed we can pass it multiple datasets with an identical number of rows, and it will split them on the same indices123from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_splittrain_set, test_set = train_test_split(housing, test_size = 0.2, random_state=42) How to avoid sampling bias? we should not have too many strata, and each stratum should be large enoughe.g. some experts told us that the median income is a very important attribute to predict median housing prices then we want to ensure that the test set is representative of the various categories of incomes in the whole dataset so we try to categories the datamethod 1: 12345678housing[&quot;income_cat&quot;] = pd.cut(housing[&quot;median_income&quot;], bins=[0., 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6., np.inf], labels=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) housing[&quot;income_cat&quot;].value_counts().sort_index().plot.bar(rot=0, grid=True)plt.xlabel(&quot;Income category&quot;)plt.ylabel(&quot;Number of districts&quot;)plt.show() Figure 2: Histogram of income categories using pd. method 2: using multiple splits 12345678from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplitsplitter = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=10, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)strat_splits = []for train_index, test_index in splitter.split(housing, housing[&quot;income_cat&quot;]): strat_train_set_n = housing.iloc[train_index] strat_test_set_n = housing.iloc[test_index] strat_splits.append([strat_train_set_n, strat_test_set_n]) we can just the first split 12strat_train_set, strat_test_set = strat_splits[0] then 12345678&gt;&gt;&gt; strat_test_set[&quot;income_cat&quot;].value_counts() / len(strat_test_set)income_cat3 0.3505332 0.3187984 0.1763575 0.1143411 0.039971Name: count, dtype: float64","link":"/2025/01/03/ML-Ch2-P1-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project/"},{"title":"The Toxicity of Solvents: A Closer Look at Why Most Solvents Are Harmful!","text":"In my current research, I frequently use n-hexane as a solvent to mix the components in my experiments. While it is effective for this purpose, I am always mindful of its toxicity. I’ve no idea about other people, but for me, I always have the intention to drink a cup of n-hexane. It’s like when someone asks you to mind the bad smell, the first reaction for me is not to cover my nose but to take a deep breath 😬. So I always need to remind myself — it’s dangerous when doing experiments. N-Hexane is known to be neurotoxic, fertility-affecting, and prolonged exposure can cause nerve damage, particularly to the extremities. This poses a significant concern for me as I handle the solvent regularly in my work. (I really hope I can quickly finish this part of work….) 🧪 What is a Solvent?A solvent is a substance that dissolves a solute, forming a solution. Solvents are widely used in chemical synthesis, industrial applications, and scientific research. A good solvent should have: High solubility for the intended solute. Volatility for easy removal after use. Chemical stability under reaction conditions. Low toxicity (but in reality, most common solvents are hazardous). ☠️ What Makes a Solvent Toxic?The toxicity of solvents often arises from their chemical properties [1]: Volatility &amp; Inhalation Risk – Many solvents evaporate quickly, making it easy to inhale toxic vapors (e.g., benzene, n-hexane). Lipid Solubility &amp; Bioaccumulation – Solvents like to dissolve in fat tissues, making them accumulate in the nervous system and organs. Metabolic Byproducts – Some solvents (e.g., methanol) are metabolized into more toxic substances in the body. Neurotoxicity – Long-term exposure can damage the nervous system, leading to symptoms like dizziness, tremors, and neuropathy. Carcinogenicity – Some solvents (e.g., benzene) are known to cause cancer with prolonged exposure. 🔬 Common Solvents and Their Toxicity [2]. Solvent Common Use Toxicity Concerns N-Hexane（正己烷） Adhesives, extractions, research Neurotoxic, affects nerves and fertility Toluene（甲苯） Paints, coatings, adhesives CNS (central nervous system) depression, liver &amp; kidney damage Methanol（甲醇） Lab solvent, fuel, antifreeze Metabolized to formaldehyde, blindness risk Benzene（笨） Industrial processes, fuels Carcinogenic, bone marrow suppression Acetone（丙酮） Nail polish remover, cleaning Irritating, but relatively safer than others Chloroform（氯仿） Old anesthetic, solvent Liver damage, suspected carcinogen 🛡️ How to Minimize Solvent Hazards1️⃣ Use Proper Ventilation Always work in a fume hood to prevent inhalation. Avoid working in enclosed spaces with volatile solvents. 2️⃣ Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Wear nitrile gloves (some solvents can penetrate latex gloves!). Use safety goggles to prevent splashes. A proper respirator (e.g., 3M 6092 or 6093 filter) when needed. I ordered 3M 7500 today. 3️⃣ Safe Handling &amp; Storage Keep solvents in properly sealed containers. Store away from heat sources to prevent evaporation and fire risks. 4️⃣ Minimize Exposure Time Plan experiments to reduce direct handling. Use safer solvent alternatives when possible. 🎯 Final ThoughtsSolvents are essential in research and industry, but their toxicity cannot be ignored. As someone who works with n-hexane, I have to be extra careful about exposure risks.There are already a lot of researchers focus on developing green solvents [3]. But in my opinion, I hope there shall be some proper robots help us do these kind of experiments in the future.. 🔬 Stay safe, and always respect the chemicals you work with!我可真是惜命啊！！！🫣 References[1]: Bruckner, James V., S.

They are the fundamental components of random forests, which are among the most powerful machine learning algorithms available today.📊 Training and Visualizing a Decision TreeTo start, we’ll train a decision tree on the well-known Iris dataset and visualize it using Graphviz. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627from sklearn.datasets import load_irisfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifierfrom sklearn.tree import export_graphvizfrom graphviz import Sourceiris = load_iris(as_frame=True)X_iris = iris.data[[&quot;petal length (cm)&quot;, &quot;petal width (cm)&quot;]].valuesy_iris = iris.targettree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=42)tree_clf.fit(X_iris, y_iris)# Define file pathsdot_filename = &quot;iris_tree.dot&quot;png_filename = &quot;iris_tree&quot;export_graphviz( tree_clf, out_file=dot_filename, feature_names=[&quot;petal length (cm)&quot;, &quot;petal width (cm)&quot;], class_names=iris.target_names, rounded=True, filled=True)graph = Source.from_file(dot_filename)graph.render(png_filename, format=&quot;png&quot;) 🔮 Making PredictionsOne of the many qualities of decision trees is that they require very little data preparation. In fact, they don’t require feature scaling or centering at all. 📏 Equation of Gini Impurity:$$Gᵢ = 1 − \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (pᵢ,ₖ)^2$$ Note: Scikit-Learn uses the CART algorithm, which produces only binary trees (trees with nodes having exactly two children). Other algorithms, like ID3, can produce trees with nodes that have more than two children. 📦 Model Interpretation: White Box vs Black BoxDecision trees are intuitive and their decisions are easy to interpret. These models are often called white box models. In contrast, random forests and neural networks are generally considered black box models because their decision-making processes are harder to interpret. The field of interpretable machine learning focuses on creating systems that can explain their decisions in a way that humans can understand. This is especially crucial in domains like healthcare and finance where fairness and accountability are paramount. 🔄 The CART Training AlgorithmCART (Classification and Regression Trees) works by splitting the training set into two subsets using a single feature k and a threshold $t_k$. It searches for the pair (k, $t_k$) that produces the purest subsets, weighted by their size. The algorithm then splits the subsets recursively until it reaches the maximum depth. It’s a greedy algorithm. ⚖️ Gini Impurity vs Entropy?Both Gini Impurity and Entropy are used to measure impurity in decision trees, but they behave slightly differently. While Gini Impurity is faster to compute, Entropy tends to produce more balanced trees. 📚 Equation of Entropy:$$Hᵢ = - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} pᵢₖ \\log_2(pᵢₖ) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad pᵢₖ \\neq 0$$ When to use Gini Impurity vs Entropy? Gini Impurity is generally faster and works well in most cases. Entropy tends to produce slightly more balanced trees but can be more computationally intensive. 🛠️ Regularization Hyperparameters Nonparametric models: These models do not have a fixed number of parameters, so they can adapt closely to the data. Parametric models: Models like linear regression have predefined parameters, limiting flexibility and reducing overfitting risk. Regularization: To avoid overfitting, we need to restrict the decision tree’s flexibility. One common way to do this is by limiting the depth of the tree. 📉 Regression with Decision TreesDecision trees are also capable of performing regression tasks. Here’s how you can train a decision tree regressor using a quadratic dataset: 12345678910111213141516import numpy as npfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressornp.random.seed(42)X_quad = np.random.rand(200, 1) - 0.5 # a single random input featurey_quad = X_quad ** 2 + 0.025 * np.random.randn(200, 1)tree_reg = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=2, random_state=42)tree_reg.fit(X_quad, y_quad)from sklearn.tree import plot_treeimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltplt.figure(figsize=(12,8))plot_tree(tree_reg, filled=True, feature_names=[&quot;X_quad&quot;], precision=2)plt.show() 🏋️ Decision Trees Have a High VarianceThe main challenge with decision trees is their high variance. Small changes to the hyperparameters or the data can produce significantly different models. To mitigate this, we can average predictions over many trees, as done in Random Forests. A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees that reduces variance and is one of the most powerful machine learning models available today.","link":"/2025/02/09/ML-Ch6-Decision-Trees/"},{"title":"2025_reading_plan","text":"2025 reading plan.April – May The Problems of Philosophy – Bertrand Russell Sophie’s World – Jostein Gaarder A Little History of the World – E.

At the same time, I’ve been learning machine learning and trying to apply it to my project which is something I hadn’t initially planned for. This made me think about what it truly means for a project to be interdisciplinary and why we feel the need to categorize everything in our lives. The Structure of Education and Its GapsI don’t know much about western education, but in China, once you choose a major, you typically follow that path throughout your studies and career. Most people end up working in a field directly related to their major. However, when we enter the real world, we quickly realize that life isn’t just about our profession. There are so many other aspects we need to understand—economics, psychology, and even basic life skills. I remember feeling shocked when I realized how many essential things were never taught in school yet are crucial for our daily lives. The Reality of Interdisciplinary WorkI experience the same kind of realization when I need to use a completely new method or concept from another discipline. It makes me question whether an education system that trains us to be experts in a single field is essentially preparing us to be just specialized tools. If real-world problems require knowledge from multiple disciplines, why do we still insist on such rigid academic boundaries? This thought became even clearer to me when I noticed that some people are hesitant to try new things simply because they’ve never learned them before. Instead of exploring, they either avoid the task or ask someone else to do it. But does that mean they truly can’t do it, or just that they assume they can’t? Inspiration from Jie QiWhile searching for something recently, I came across Jie Qi—a designer, educator, inventor, and entrepreneurJie Qi. Her work blends design and electronics in a way that makes technology both creative and engaging. Seeing how she bridges different fields made me realize that the most interesting innovations often come from people who don’t limit themselves to just one discipline. Breaking Free from BoundariesThis makes me wonder: Are the boundaries we set for ourselves necessary, or are they just artificial limits created by our education and mindset? If we were encouraged to explore beyond our expertise, how much more could we achieve? Maybe it’s time to rethink how we approach learning—not just as a path to specialization, but as a journey of discovery across multiple fields.","link":"/2025/03/18/Interdisciplary-project/"},{"title":"Miles and Moments_20250322","text":"This month has been a whirlwind of events. The previous tenant ended our contract, prompting us to search for a replacement. Fortunately, I found a suitable tenant—thanks to the power of the internet, which made communication between Belgium and Shanghai much easier. With my mom and sister’s support, the transition was swift and smooth. Emotionally, it has been a rollercoaster. I celebrated my best friend’s delivery from afar, unable to be there with her. I missed another dear friend’s wedding, a once-in-a-lifetime moment I wish I could have attended. A close colleague’s family struggles weighed on me, and I found myself grappling with a nagging sense of inadequacy compared to my master student. I deeply missed my husband, felt the sting of betrayal from someone I once called a good friend, and endured persistent dizziness, fearing I had been poisoned by chemical exposure. As if that weren’t enough, a viral infection left my right eye red and swollen. Writing all of this down feels strangely fascinating. There were moments when I wanted to escape—to leave everything behind. I longed to be held by my mother, the way she cradles my little niece with such warmth and tenderness. But over time, I’ve come to realize that I am my own constant—the one person who will always be with me and truly understand me. Over the years, I’ve grown more emotionally resilient. Yet, I still find myself easily affected by a single sentence or a fleeting glance from others. The good news is that I’m beginning to understand myself more deeply. I’m learning how to regulate my emotions, practicing mindfulness, and meditating to process my thoughts and feelings. Step by step, I tackle each challenge, and with every problem I solve, I feel a little stronger. Through it all, I’m grateful to have kind and supportive people around me—my husband, my family, my supervisor, my master student, my colleagues, and my lifelong friends. What more could I ask for? Giving is always more fulfilling than receiving. I hope to cultivate the strength to enrich myself while also sharing what I have with others—to become a better version of myself. It rained today, but I still went for a run with my hat on. As always, the air was fresh, and running never let me down. Thanks for all I have.","link":"/2025/03/22/Miles-and-Moments-20250322/"},{"title":"Best wearable device (smart sensors) labs worldwide!","text":"This blog aims to list and update the best research labs working on wearable devices and smart sensors worldwide.🌍 _Last updated: 2025-03-29🔬 Featured LabsBao Research Group📍 Location: Stanford University, USA🔬 Key Researchers: Prof. Zhenan Bao🔍 Focus Areas: Flexible and stretchable electronics Wearable sensors Skin-inspired electronics Organic semiconductors📄 Notable Publications: Skin-Inspired Electronics: An Emerging Paradigm - Nature, 2017 Flexible Electronics and Sensors for Health Monitoring - Nature Reviews Materials, 2019 🌏 Labs by Region🇺🇸 North America Bao Research Group – Stanford University, USA 🇪🇺 Europe🇨🇳 Asia🌍 Other Regions 🆕 Latest Updates 2025-03-29: Added Bao Research Group at Stanford University.","link":"/2025/03/29/Best-wearable-device-smart-sensors-labs-worldwide/"},{"title":"Miles and Moments_20250329","text":"Still feeling a little dizzy—it’s been a while. But spring is always glorious, and Brugge never loses its charm. As I was running, I started to understand more and more why my dear colleague, GDR, enjoys bird spotting. Europe, especially Brugge, is truly home to so many birds. These lively creatures, some tiny, some astonishingly large, each have their own unique beauty. After my run, I had a video call with my family. It was a special moment—the first time I played the ukulele in front of my adorable niece and my whole family. I sang 红日, my favorite Cantonese song. I miss you.","link":"/2025/03/29/Miles-and-Moments-20250329/"},{"title":"Miles and Moments_20250406","text":"We absorb a vast amount of information every day—some consciously, some passively. In an age where everyone can be a broadcaster on social media, it becomes increasingly difficult to discern what is true and what is false, what is good and what is harmful. As researchers, we are trained to question everything with a critical mind. But without a calm inner center, even we can be swept away by the noise. Lately, I’ve felt more and more like I’m growing—like a tree. Insects, birds, small animals—they come and go. But I remain. Quietly, steadily, I grow. I shape myself into something I admire. My roots stretch deeper, I hum in the wind. I welcome both sunshine and rain, and endure snow and drought with equal grace. I have companions too. Sometimes we whisper through the breeze, but most of the time, we simply share the silence. I treasure this slow and solitary journey—not like grass that spreads quickly, nor like vines that climb others. I am just myself. Standing tall. With the sun and the moon. Today feels like a milestone. I told myself: it’s time to return to my own rhythm. For too long, I did research in a state of stress—nervous, concerned about others’ opinions. I nearly forgot: I am a tree. I don’t need to become someone else. I want to become someone I admire—resilient, brave, independent, and full of love and inner peace.","link":"/2025/04/06/Miles-and-Moments-20250406/"}],"tags":[{"name":"morning_flowers","slug":"morning-flowers","link":"/tags/morning-flowers/"},{"name":"PDMS","slug":"PDMS","link":"/tags/PDMS/"},{"name":"Graphene","slug":"Graphene","link":"/tags/Graphene/"},{"name":"Materials","slug":"Materials","link":"/tags/Materials/"},{"name":"3D-Printed","slug":"3D-Printed","link":"/tags/3D-Printed/"},{"name":"PressureSensor","slug":"PressureSensor","link":"/tags/PressureSensor/"},{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","link":"/tags/Machine-Learning/"},{"name":"Hands-On Machine Learning","slug":"Hands-On-Machine-Learning","link":"/tags/Hands-On-Machine-Learning/"},{"name":"running","slug":"running","link":"/tags/running/"},{"name":"10 km","slug":"10-km","link":"/tags/10-km/"},{"name":"Bruges","slug":"Bruges","link":"/tags/Bruges/"},{"name":"SJTU","slug":"SJTU","link":"/tags/SJTU/"},{"name":"Hydrogel","slug":"Hydrogel","link":"/tags/Hydrogel/"},{"name":"Soft Robotics","slug":"Soft-Robotics","link":"/tags/Soft-Robotics/"},{"name":"Cryogenic Printing","slug":"Cryogenic-Printing","link":"/tags/Cryogenic-Printing/"},{"name":"Nature Communications","slug":"Nature-Communications","link":"/tags/Nature-Communications/"},{"name":"Multimaterial Printing","slug":"Multimaterial-Printing","link":"/tags/Multimaterial-Printing/"},{"name":"wearable devices","slug":"wearable-devices","link":"/tags/wearable-devices/"},{"name":"questions","slug":"questions","link":"/tags/questions/"},{"name":"depression","slug":"depression","link":"/tags/depression/"},{"name":"conferences","slug":"conferences","link":"/tags/conferences/"},{"name":"Dutch","slug":"Dutch","link":"/tags/Dutch/"},{"name":"Interesting Things","slug":"Interesting-Things","link":"/tags/Interesting-Things/"},{"name":"AI","slug":"AI","link":"/tags/AI/"},{"name":"diabetic foot","slug":"diabetic-foot","link":"/tags/diabetic-foot/"},{"name":"euthanasia","slug":"euthanasia","link":"/tags/euthanasia/"},{"name":"Belgium","slug":"Belgium","link":"/tags/Belgium/"},{"name":"motivation","slug":"motivation","link":"/tags/motivation/"},{"name":"Brussels","slug":"Brussels","link":"/tags/Brussels/"},{"name":"culture difference","slug":"culture-difference","link":"/tags/culture-difference/"},{"name":"wearable sensors","slug":"wearable-sensors","link":"/tags/wearable-sensors/"},{"name":"seminar","slug":"seminar","link":"/tags/seminar/"},{"name":"Stanford University","slug":"Stanford-University","link":"/tags/Stanford-University/"},{"name":"deep learning","slug":"deep-learning","link":"/tags/deep-learning/"},{"name":"家","slug":"家","link":"/tags/%E5%AE%B6/"},{"name":"solvent","slug":"solvent","link":"/tags/solvent/"},{"name":"n-hexane","slug":"n-hexane","link":"/tags/n-hexane/"},{"name":"chemistry","slug":"chemistry","link":"/tags/chemistry/"},{"name":"Cambridge","slug":"Cambridge","link":"/tags/Cambridge/"},{"name":"cat","slug":"cat","link":"/tags/cat/"},{"name":"reading","slug":"reading","link":"/tags/reading/"},{"name":"plan","slug":"plan","link":"/tags/plan/"},{"name":"biofabrication","slug":"biofabrication","link":"/tags/biofabrication/"},{"name":"University of Cambridge","slug":"University-of-Cambridge","link":"/tags/University-of-Cambridge/"},{"name":"3D printing","slug":"3D-printing","link":"/tags/3D-printing/"},{"name":"life","slug":"life","link":"/tags/life/"}],"categories":[{"name":"articles","slug":"articles","link":"/categories/articles/"},{"name":"literatureReview","slug":"literatureReview","link":"/categories/literatureReview/"},{"name":"keeplearning","slug":"keeplearning","link":"/categories/keeplearning/"},{"name":"runEmilyRun","slug":"articles/runEmilyRun","link":"/categories/articles/runEmilyRun/"},{"name":"seminars","slug":"keeplearning/seminars","link":"/categories/keeplearning/seminars/"},{"name":"readings","slug":"readings","link":"/categories/readings/"}],"pages":[{"title":"Introduction","text":"“Every person’s life is a journey toward himself, the attempt at a journey, the intimation of a path. No person has ever been completely himself, but each one strives to become so, some gropingly, others more lucidly, according to his abilities.” — Hermann Hesse, Demian Who am IHi, I’m PENG Sai (彭赛), and I also go by my English name, Emily, which I chose back in middle school. I’m a Ph.D. researcher at KU Leuven in Belgium, exploring topics like embedded systems, wearable devices, smart sensors, and soft robotics. My ultimate goal is to develop technologies that make a real difference in healthcare and rehabilitation. Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I worked at Microsoft and Micron. Back then, I felt like a ship adrift, chasing milestones like earning money, getting married, buying a house, and climbing the career ladder, but without a true sense of purpose. The COVID-19 lockdown gave me the time to work from home and reflect on life’s bigger questions. It was during this period that I decided to pursue a Ph.D. Witnessing the struggles of a loved one battling cancer and the many heartbreaking stories I encountered at the hospital further solidified my resolve to contribute meaningfully to the world. Why this siteI’ve been blogging since 2012, starting on CSDN, then transitioning to a Chinese public account, and eventually to GitHub. Writing has always been a personal joy for me, a way to document my thoughts and, with luck, connect with others who share similar interests. This site serves a few key purposes: Showcasing my independent research and its outcomes Documenting my personal achievements Highlighting the challenges I aim to tackle Exploring and discussing wearable and smart devices, along with their real-world applications I may not have the answer to life’s ultimate question, but I know I’m on a journey that brings me fulfillment. That’s a good start.希望你走过很多路，最后找到你自己。","link":"/index.html"},{"title":"","text":"/* 调整页面主要内容和侧边栏的宽度 */ .page-main { width: calc(100% - 200px); /* 主内容区域宽度，200px 是侧边栏宽度 */ max-width: none; /* 取消最大宽度限制 */ margin: 0 auto; box-sizing: border-box; /* 包含 padding 和 border */ } .site-title { font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif; /* Change the font-family */ color: #333333; /* 标题颜色 */ text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* 添加阴影 */ border-bottom: 2px solid #ddd; /* 底部划线 */ padding-bottom: 10px; /* 调整下边距 */ margin-bottom: 20px; /* 与正文保持间距 */ } .sidebar { width: 200px; /* 侧边栏宽度 */ box-sizing: border-box; /* 包含 padding 和 border */ } /* 调整整体布局 */ .content-wrapper { display: flex; max-width: 1400px; /* 整体页面宽度 */ margin: 0 auto; /* 居中对齐 */ flex-wrap: wrap; /* 使布局元素在较小的屏幕上换行 */ padding: 0 15px; /* 为整个页面提供一些内边距 */ } /* Flexbox布局：主内容和侧边栏 */ .content-wrapper .page-main { flex: 1; /* 主内容占据剩余空间 */ } .content-wrapper .sidebar { flex: 0 0 200px; /* 侧边栏保持固定宽度 */ } /* 响应式调整：在较小屏幕时恢复默认布局 */ @media (max-width: 768px) { .content-wrapper { flex-direction: column; /* 使主内容和侧边栏垂直排列 */ } .page-main { width: 100%; /* 主内容占满屏幕 */ padding: 0 15px; /* 增加左右留白 */ } .sidebar { width: 100%; /* 侧边栏宽度随屏幕变化 */ margin-bottom: 20px; /* 增加侧边栏下方留白 */ } .post-title, h1 { font-size: 2em; /* 缩小字体大小以适应小屏幕 */ } .site-title { font-size: 28px; /* 缩小标题字体大小 */ } } /* Target the main content container */ .main-content, .content, .post { width: 90%; /* Make the content container 90% of the viewport width */ max-width: none; /* Remove any max-width restriction */ margin: 0 auto; /* Center the content */ padding: 20px; /* Add padding around the content */ } /* If the content is inside another container, like a wrapper, adjust it as well */ .wrapper { width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; /* Set a max width for very large screens */ margin: 0 auto; } /* Adjusting for smaller screens */ @media (max-width: 768px) { .main-content, .content, .post { width: 100%; /* Make sure the content takes up full width on small screens */ padding: 10px; /* Reduce padding on smaller screens */ } }","link":"/css/custom.css"},{"title":"Publications","text":"Journals 9.
